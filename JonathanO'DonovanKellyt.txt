20/10/20 My 3 game suggestions are:
1. Have it have a level up system where it can improve it's speed, fire rate and damge the weapons do.
2. Have planets with different levels of gravity.
3. Have quests where you can deliver cargo and upgrade ship parts

My Part is to make a laser for the spaceship, I believe that lasers should be a damage over time as opposed to shooting little lasers
so I think the laser should follow the cursor and damage the durability of the asteroid which could also potentially be upgraded.
