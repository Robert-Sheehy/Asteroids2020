13/10/2020 - Created work log file and I am attemting to supmit to the main repo.

14/10/2020 - Assignment 2 - Start.

Implemention idea 1 - We could set it up that our spaceship will switch between 
                      missiles and a gun by a button press command which will 
                      then have different levels of damage towards what ever 
                      our enemie types will end up being. 

Implemention idea 2 - We could add an explosion mechanic onto the missiles for
                      when they come into contect with our enemie types to make 
                      them have more damage but to off set this make there reload
                      time to perhaps somthing like 5 to 10 seconds, and make 
                      the gun shoot faster but have less damage then the missiles.
                      
Implemention idea 3 - Adding a vapour trail or smoke coming out the back of the 
                      engine could be an interesting idea aswell, it would hav 
                      to be set up to fad away not to far off from the ship 
                      otherwise it would get annoy if you flewback into it.

20/10/2020 - Missile Lanch - Starting, What I want to do Plan.

                      For the missile lunch code I would like first have two missiles
                      possitioned with one each on the left and right wings. But 
                      then for the actually lanching I would like to leave it up 
                      to the player witch way they would like to shoot them by have 
                      an ear on the 'E', 'R' and 'T' bottons.
                      
                      The 'T' botton will have both of the missiles fire simultaneously,
                      but make them both unuseable for 2  seconds. The 'E' botton 
                      will soley fire the left missile and make it unuseable for 
                      2  seconds. The 'R' botton will fire the right missile and also
                      making it unuseable for 2  seconds.
                      
                      With the 2 second cool down timer on the missile then
                      when you fire both you have more damage give but 2 seconds of
                      nothing to fire or you could fire one and then in that ones
                      cold down time you fire the other, this could add an element of
                      difficulty to the game.
