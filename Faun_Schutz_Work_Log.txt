13/10/2020 - Created work log file and I am attemting to supmit to the main repo.

14/10/2020 - Assignment 2 - Start

Implemention idea 1 - We could set it up that our spaceship will switch between 
                      missiles and a gun by a button press command which will 
                      then have different levels of damage towards what ever 
                      our enemie types will end up being. 

Implemention idea 2 - We could add an explosion mechanic onto the missiles for
                      when they come into contect with our enemie types to make 
                      them have more damage but to off set this make there reload
                      time to perhaps somthing like 5 to 10 seconds, and make 
                      the gun shoot faster but have less damage then the missiles.
                      
Implemention idea 3 - Adding a vapour trail or smoke coming out the back of the 
                      engine could be an interesting idea aswell, it would hav 
                      to be set up to fad away not to far off from the ship 
                      otherwise it would get annoy if you flewback into it.
