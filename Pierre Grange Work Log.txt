Items to implement in the game :
-Planets
-Lazers
-Missiles


Create an asteroids script :
-Asteroids need to move in a straight direction
-Their speed is random (we should define a minimum and a maximum, depends on the max speed of the ship)
-Big asteroids generate 2 to 3 smaller ones when they are destroyed
-Big asteroids have XXX health points (depends on how much damage does a lazer deals)
-Small asteroids have XX health points
-Destroying a big asteroid grant the player XX points
-Destroying a small asteroid grant the player XX points

More Ideas :
-Average speed of the asteroids increases with the timer/with the points earned
-Spawning rate increases the same way
