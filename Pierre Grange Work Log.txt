Items to implement in the game :
-Planets
-Lazers
-Missiles


Create an asteroids script :
-Asteroids need to move in a straight direction
-Asteroids have a random rotation speed on a random axis
-Their speed is random (we should define a minimum and a maximum, depends on the max speed of the ship)
-Big asteroids generate 2 to 3 smaller ones when they are destroyed
-Big asteroids have XXX health points (depends on how much damage does a lazer deals)
-Small asteroids have XX health points
-Small asteroids are faster than big asteroids
-Destroying a big asteroid grant the player XX points
-Destroying a small asteroid grant the player XX points


More Ideas :
-Average speed of the asteroids increases with the timer/with the points earned
-Spawning rate increases the same way



Spawner = empty game object with parameters :
-number of asteroids
-list of asteroids in spawner
-Removes them when they are down to 0 HP
-Spawns two small ones at the location of the destroyed asteroid.

+ Spawn at random place
