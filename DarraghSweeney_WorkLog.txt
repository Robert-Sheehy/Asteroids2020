13/10/2020: Created work log,Attempting to upload to main GuiHub.

20/10/20: Spaceship game ideas: Add astroids,
                                Add loot/Currency that enemies drop,
                                Add space station where loot can be sold and upgrades for ship can be bought.  

21/10/20:My part of the Spaceship game is to design and implement the menu, For the menu I'd like to use maybe a light blue opaque, hologram-esque, menu.The menu will need options such as a start button to get into the game, maybe an options 
menu for lowering game volume and a credits are for crediting each students work.

    For the code I would have to use C# to implement a GUI for when the game is first booted up and then possibly some IF statements for when a buttonn is clicked.
